## Description
A weather app of the 200 most populous cities in the world. Created as a learning project in conjunction with <a href="http://code.sydney">code.sydney</a>

This website is a single page application created in Vue along with Buefy. Real-time weather information is provided by API calls to Open Weather. The returned latitude and longitude of the city was fed into Google Maps to produce the map.
